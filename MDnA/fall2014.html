<P><STRONG>Synopsis:</STRONG>
This course studies the design of mechanisms to mediate the
interaction of strategic individuals so that desirable outcomes are
attained. A central theme will be the tradeoff between optimality of
an objective such as revenue or welfare and other desirable properties
such as simplicity, robustness, computational tractability, and
practicality. This tradeoff will be quantified by a theory of
approximation which measures the loss of performance of a simple,
robust, and practical approximation mechanism in comparison to the
complicated and delicate optimal mechanism. The class focuses on
techniques for performing this analysis, economic conclusions, and
consequences for practice. The class will follow the textbook
manuscript at: <A HREF=http://jasonhartline.com/MDnA/>http://jasonhartline.com/MDnA/<A>.

<P><STRONG>Prerequisites:</STRONG> Prior experience with algorithms or
game theory is recommended.</P>

<P><STRONG>Grading:</STRONG> 60% problem sets, 40% research project, 10% classroom participation (bonus).

<P><STRONG>Homework Policy:</STRONG> Homeworks are to be done in
pairs. Both students must contribute to the solution of all
problems. One copy of the assignment should be turned in with the
names of both students on it. Both students will receive the same
grade. You may consult the text book and course notes when answering
homework questions; you must not consult the Internet or research
papers.</P>
