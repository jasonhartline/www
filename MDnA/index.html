<P><STRONG>Synopsis:</STRONG>
The text <I>Mechanism Design and Approximation</I> is based on a
graduate course that has been developed at Northwestern over the past
decade.  It presents the classical theory of economic mechanism design and
introduces a new theory of approximation for mechanism design.</P>

<p><STRONG>Excerpt from Chapter 1:</STRONG> <A HREF=MDnA-ch1.pdf>[ch1.pdf]</A><BR>
Our world is an interconnected collection of economic and
computational systems.  Within such a system, individuals optimize
their actions to achieve their own, perhaps selfish, goals; and the
system combines these actions with its basic laws to produce an
outcome.  Some of these systems perform well, e.g., the national residency
matching program which assigns medical students to residency programs
in hospitals, e.g., auctions for online advertising on Internet search
engines; and some of these systems perform poorly, e.g., financial
markets during the 2008 meltdown, e.g., gridlocked transportation
networks.  The success and failure of these systems depends on the
basic laws governing the system.  Financial regulation can prevent
disastrous market meltdowns, congestion protocols can prevent gridlock
in transportation networks, and market and auction design can lead to
mechanisms for allocating and exchanging goods or services that yield
higher profits or increased value to society.

<P>
This text focuses on a combined computational and economic theory for
the study and design of mechanisms.  A central theme will be the
tradeoff between optimality and other desirable properties such as
simplicity, robustness, computational tractability, and practicality.
This tradeoff will be quantified by a theory of approximation which
measures the loss of performance of a simple, robust, and practical
approximation mechanism in comparison to the complicated and delicate
optimal mechanism.  The theory provided does not necessarily suggest
mechanisms that should be deployed in practice, instead, it pinpoints
salient features of good mechanisms that should be a starting point
for the practitioner.
